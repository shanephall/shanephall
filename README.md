# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane Hall

I build software products, from early startups like [Userplane](https://web.archive.org/web/20080531021035/http://www.userplane.com/index.cfm) to growth-stage companies like [Zynga](Zynga.com). Currently I'm helping SMBs deploy current LLM/MCP tech to accelerate their business.

ðŸš€ Interested in product, AI, or something cool? Letâ€™s connect.
